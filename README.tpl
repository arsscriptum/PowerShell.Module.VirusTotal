PowerShell Module to call [OpenAI Developer API functions](https://api.OpenAI.com/)

The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or code. You need to use different [models](https://github.com/arsscriptum/PowerShell.Module.OpenAI/blob/master/doc/Get-OpenAIModels.md) for different tasks, and you can fine-tune your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from **content generation to semantic search and classification.**
